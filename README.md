# Acoustic-Room-Recreation

•	Created an Android application that utilizes an external microphone to capture sound from a speaker and extract room impulse response by a peak detection algorithm.
•	Sorted returned echoes and eliminated redundant combinations of echoes.
•	Utilized the LRS computational geometry library to implement the solution to the vertex enumeration problem to help recreate the room by extracting the vertices of the room and eliminating vertices that are either too close or that are formed by H-Space representations that are redundant.
•	Implemented in as proof of concept in Python and as a mobile application in C++ and Java.

This was submitted as part of the final design project for ECE 420 - Embedded DSP Labaratory.
